## Input

-   No bind id is provided
-   No axes information is provided [x, y]
-   No lower and upper limits are provided for axes
-   No Y axis label is provided
-   No data is provided
-   No data key is provided
-   Data keys are not unique (If multiple data-sets are provided)
-   No data values are not provided

## Axis Type: Timeseries

-   Data points are type `timeseries` but the x-axis bounds are `default`
-   Data points are type `default` but the x-axis bounds are `timeseries`
-   Data point values provided should be in UTC
-   Data point values provided should be in [RFC 3339](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3339.html) format

## Constraints

#### Legend

-   `Legend` only loads if the data-set label is provided
    -   This is part of a functionality, any `content` using Graph API will have the ability to load data within graph and not show legend item
-   `Graph` and `Legend` can be loaded in a separate containers when `bindTo` and `bindLegendTo` element id's are provided respectively

#### Axis

-   If `y2` axis is enabled, then the data-sets expect the `yAxis: "y2"` property

#### Data point OnClick

-   The `onClick` property needs to be a callback function
-   Callback function will be called on click of a data point, this function will determine the action performed

#### Locale

-   If `locale` is provided, `ticks.format` is expected to be provided as well otherwise there is no effect on the graph itself.

#### Data point values

-   `values` will not be subjected to any kind of pre-processing before generating the graph. `values` co-ordinates are expected to be linear/sorted.
