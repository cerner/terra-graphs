This repo consists of two packages: 
1. Carbon-graphs: Vanilla JavaScript implementation of the graphing library.
2. Terra-graphs: React implementation of graphing library.

<h3 id="versioning">
  Versioning
</h3>

When a component reaches v1.0.0., it is considered to be stable and will follow [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
1. MAJOR versions represent breaking changes
2. MINOR versions represent added functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
3. PATCH versions represent backwards-compatible bug fixes

Consult the component CHANGELOGs, related issues, and PRs for more information.

We view the React.js props API of our components as our main public API. We use this to guide us when versioning components.

Prior to components reaching v1.0.0, a component is considered to be in a beta stage.
Components in beta stage may include breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes all within v0.x.x releases.
